# PowerBI_dashboard
Problem statement - AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.
Using the data provided by AtliQ Grands we have to build a dashboard which gives a comprehensive overview of the data and improves decision making by providing the insights about the data.

# Some Key-metrics to be considered to build a dashboard in hospitality domain
1.	Revenue – The total revenue realized.
2.	RevPAR - RevPAR stands for Revenue per Available room. RevPAR represents the revenue generated per available room, whether or not they are occupied. This helps hotels measure their revenue generating performance to accurately price rooms.
3.	OCC % (Occupancy %) – Occupancy means the total successful bookings happened to the total rooms available.
4.	ADR (Average Daily Rate) – it is the ratio of total rooms booked/sold. It is the measure of average paid for rooms sold in a given time period.
5.	DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights) – This metrics tells on average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day considering a time period.

# Steps Performed to build the Dashboard
